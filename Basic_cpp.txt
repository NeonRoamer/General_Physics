Important things to know:
1 all variables and functions need to say what type of variable is being outputted (int, string, vector, etc)
2 float exists in c++ but is a smaller size the equivalent of python float is called double (as in double the length of float)
3 void means it returns nothing
4 vectors can only hold one type of variable wich needs to be specified (eg vector<int>)
5 the & symbol in the functions inputs means instead of making a copy of the input it uses the same one (this is for optimisation)
6 for loops are split into three bits   for(int i{0}; i<4; ++i)
  the int i{0} is creating a variable i that is an int with a value of 0. This is done once in the for loops
  the i<4 is the condition for the foor loop to end
  the ++i is the equivalent to i += 1 or i = i+1 this is repeated at the end of every loop.
7 int variable{3}; is the equivalent of int variable = 3 but is faster.
8 whitespace means nothing in c++ instead the use of {} are used the say what is within the loop, function, etc
9 // is to comment the quivalent of # in python

Classes
1 int, float, string are classes. I have made a class called celestial_object.
2 same as with append to a list in python is how you use member functions of the class. 
  For example mylist.append(3) in python and celestial_object.get_mass()
  the get_mass() can be any member function in the class. These can all be viewed in the corresponding .h file
3 the .h file includes the class and functions which are one line. If the function is more than 
  one line only the initialisation of it is in the .h file. Then the function is written in the .cpp file with the same name.
  In the .cpp file the functions will have Celestial_object:: between the return type and function name this is to signify it is
  part of the class Celestial_object.
