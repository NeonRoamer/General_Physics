Setting initial conditions
	(Asteroid is based off of Ceres)
	Mass of Earth = 5.9722e24 kg
	Mass of Moon = 7.348e22
	Mass of Asteroid (Ceres) = 9.39e20 kg

	Radius of Earth = 6.378e6 m
	Radius of Moon = 1.737e6 m
	Radius of Asteroid = 4.73e5 m

	* = Before further adjustments
	Earth initial position = [0, 0, 0] m
	Moon initial position = [3.844e8, 0, 0] m
	*Asteroid initial position = [3.88e9, 0, 0] m
		
	*Earth initial velocity = [0, 0, 0] ms^-1
	*Moon initial velocity = [0, 1.022e3, 0] ms^-1
	*Asteroid initial velocity = [-3.88e9/(60*60*24*15), 0, 0] ms^-1 -> Set velocity so the asteroid arrives in 15 days

	Apply the accelerations at an angle theta (0 = along +x axis), and phi about x axis (0 = along +y axis)
		These are angles relative to displacement vector from the earth to the asteroid

	Rotate the asteroid position, velocity and acceleration about the y axis by an inclination angle (inc) using the matrix:
		[[cos(inc),	0, -sin(inc)],
		 [	0,	1,	0],
		 [sin(inc),	0, cos(inc)]]

	Reset the velocity of the Earth to deduct drift

	Do simulation
	
	Repeat the simulations for random values in a range of acceleration magnitudes and theta/phi, log the results (collision/avoid) with the set acceleration magnitudes and theta/phi

Range to test constant acceleration: 1e15 - 1.5e16 N
Range to test deflection impulse: 1e21 - 1e22 Ns
